- Mini-max Sum:
	- Time complexity: with a 'for' loop, the time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length 
	of the input string s, because it performs a constant-time operation for each character in the string.

	- Space complexity: The space complexity of this code is O(1), which means it uses a constant 
	amount of additional space regardless of the size of the input string s.

-HackerRank in a String:
	- Time complexity: with a 'while' loop, the time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the 
	length of the input string s, as it also perform constant-time operations for every character.

	- Space complexity: the space complexity is O(1), because the code uses a constant amount of memory 
	as the size of the input does not impact the space complexity.
